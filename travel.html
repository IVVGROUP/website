<h3>Recent Client Tesimonials:</h3>

<h5>Name: Sam & Grace Michael // Destination: Caribbean Sailing</h5>
<h4> "The trip was great. We flew down to St Maarten for two days before boarding the ship.
    Big parties every night. The ship anchored out and provided tender service that was excellent. 
    Some of the places I had never heard of like Yost Van Dyke, Les Saintes, and Soper's Hole were a blast." </h4><br>

    <h5>Name: Olivia Schneider // Destination: Cancun Riviera Maya</h5>
    <h4> "I got this deal the day before and I couldn't have been happier!!!!!! I would suggest anyone doing this deal. It was inexpensive but the resort (Now Jade Riviera) was nuts!!
Restauarants and pool-side bars every way you turn - NO RESERVATIONS REQUIRED, countless spa and beauty options, and unlimited amenities partnered with the resort."</h4><br>

    <h5>Name: Ava Hanson // Destination: Norwegian Cruise from Miami</h5>
        <h4>"We LOVED IT!!! Thanks for the upgrade, enjoyed the balcony and the 10th floor was a great location!! 
            No problem at all the kids being on a different deck and so glad they had there room and we had ours.
            I would recommend NCL to anyone, even my college-age girls who were worried that NCL wouldn’t be a party boat loved it. 
            The NCL Crew were hilarious (loved Marky Mark the CD and Hector the Asst. CD) everyone just so happy to serve you and to make sure you were involved and having a great time. 
            Plenty of food choices never went hungry or thirsty that’s for sure. 
            Always something to do with the nightly shows and then the game show themes in the lounge after that. " </h4>
